# Julia Error Handling Example

This example demonstrates a common error in Julia: improper error handling in functions. The `myfunction` function is designed to only accept non-negative numbers. If a negative number is passed, it throws an error, halting the program's execution. The `bugSolution.jl` shows how to improve the error handling.
